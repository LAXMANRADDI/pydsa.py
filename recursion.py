Recursion is used in linked lists, trees, backtracking, DP, quicksort, mergesort, etc.

function calling itself until a stopping condition.

def fun():
    fun() #This will run forever →  infinite recursion.

amd Every recursive function must have:
Base Case → stopping condition
Recursive Case → function calling itself
