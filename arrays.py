 Array :An array is a continuous block of memory holding elements of the same type.
i.e
Index:   0   1   2   3   4
Value:  10  20  30  40  50
In low-level languages (C/C++), arrays have fixed size.
In Python, arrays are implemented using lists (dynamic arrays).

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(arr) # [10, 20 , 30 , 40]
