TIME COMPLXITY :
Time Complexity = How fast an algorithm grows as input size **n** increases.
It does NOT measure seconds.
It measures **growth rate**.

---
Big-O describes the **maximum** time taken as n becomes very large.

Common complexities:
 Big-O           Name         Fast?                  
 **O(1)**        Constant      Fastest              
 **O(log n)**    Logarithmic  Very fast              
 **O(n)**        Linear       Normal
 **O(n log n)**  Log-linear  Slower                 
 **O(n²)**       Quadratic   Slow                   
 **O(2ⁿ)**      Exponential  Very slow              
 **O(n!)**       Factorial     Impossible for big n

Time grows directly with size.

AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  :

Array :An array is a continuous block of memory holding elements of the same type.
i.e
Index:   0   1   2   3   4
Value:  10  20  30  40  50
In low-level languages (C/C++), arrays have fixed size.
In Python, arrays are implemented using lists (dynamic arrays).

1]Creating Arrays (Lists) in Python
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(arr) # [10, 20 , 30 , 40]

2] Access
print(arr[0])   # 10
print(arr[2])   # 30

2.2] Update
arr[1] = 200
print(arr)   # [10, 200, 30, 40]

2.3] Insert
At end → append()
arr.append(50)
At specific index → insert()
arr.insert(2, 999)

2.4] Delete
delete by index
del arr[3]
delete by value
arr.remove(30)
delete last
arr.pop()

 3]. Array Traversal
Going through each element.
arr = [10,20,30,40]
for x in arr:
    print(x)

4].  Linear Search (O(n))
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
print(linear_search([10,20,30,40], 30))  # 2


SEARCHING TECHNIQUES:

1. Linear Search (O(n))

Check every element until you find the target.
i.e
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

Example:

linear_search([10, 20, 30, 40], 30)
# Output: 2


---
2. Binary Search (O(log n)) — Very Important
 Works only on a SORTED array
Divide the array into half every step.

Binary Search Code (Iterative)

def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1 


Example 1: Linear Search
Q: Find element = 30 in arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Dry Run:
i=0 → arr[0]=10  ≠30  
i=1 → arr[1]=20  ≠30  
i=2 → arr[2]=30  ✓ found

Code:
def linear_search(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1

print(linear_search([10,20,30,40], 30))


Example 2: Binary Search
Q: Search 40 in [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Dry Run:
low=0, high=5  
mid=2 → arr[2]=30 < 40 → search right
low=3, high=5  
mid=4 → arr[4]=50 > 40 → search left
low=3, high=3  
mid=3 → arr[3]=40 → FOUND
Code:
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low, high = 0, len(arr)-1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return -1
